## Problem statement
I have a large collection of photographs, videos and other documents scattared over multiple drives and directories on my Linux desktop. Many of these documents are duplicates but they may have different filenames and use different resolution. Some of the video files may start with a channel advertizement in the first 15 seconds.

I will like to develop a python GTK 4 based utility which will do and include following

1) Allow configuring list of file locations to include or exclude to define the scope of file-search database. File-search database must maintain complete location for each file.
2) Allow a button and keystroke shortcut <Ctrl + Shift + R> to manually refresh the search database

3) An easy interface (text entry box) where one can enter the string to be used as a search pattern or search criteria. In most cases the search criteria will be a substring to match among all the filenames in the search database. But allow the search criteria term to be a regex or even a substring to match against not just the filename but complete file path.
4) Also include some menu items and buttons to include additional search criterias such as
   - Detect all duplicate files based on file name and size
   - Detect all files that are very closely related based fuzzy or intelligent search and analysis of the database - Use NLP to arrive at categorize such as topics, person names, channel name
   - Detect all duplicate files based on file hash
   - Detect all duplicate files based on thumbnail fuzzy match
   - Detect all directories that are empty
   - Detect all filenames with unusual and unsafe characters
   - Detect all files with unusual and unsafe characters

5) An easy interface to present all the files that match the search criteria in a tabular form where each row is a file matching the search criteria and columns indicating the file attributes (filename, location, other metadata that can be computed or analyzed based on the file contents.)
6) An easy interface to present all the files that match the search criteria using thumbnails and other known or analyzable metadata

7) I also want the UI control to take actions on files that match the "search criteria".
   Examples:
   A) Mark duplicate files (Keep the file with most descriptive name and best resolution while removing others )
   B) Remove duplicate files
   C) Select one or more files
   D) View a single selected Photo or media

Help me refine these requirements as a revised prompt with "MVP-First Approach"
  - Focus on core functionality before infrastructure
  - Prioritize user-visible features over code quality in early phases
  - Build comprehensive testing after feature validation

Plan Iterative User Validation
  - Implement incremental demo sessions with working prototypes
  - Create detailed UI wireframes before coding begins

---

I'll help you refine this into a well-structured MVP-first approach that aligns with your expertise goals in professional, secure, and modular development. Let me break this down into phases with clear priorities.

## Key Refinements

**MVP-First Approach**: I've broken down your comprehensive feature set into 4 distinct phases, each delivering working functionality that users can validate. This prevents over-engineering and ensures you're building what users actually need.

**Professional Architecture**: The project structure follows Python best practices with clear separation of concerns - UI, core business logic, utilities, and analysis modules. This supports your goal of creating modular, reusable components.

**Security & Standards Focus**: Each phase includes validation criteria that emphasize safe file operations, proper error handling, and standards compliance (GTK4, PEP 8, etc.).

**TDD Integration**: The testing strategy is built into the development plan from the start, with specific test categories and coverage targets.

**Claude CLI Optimization**: I've included specific ways to leverage Claude CLI throughout the development workflow for code generation, review, testing, and documentation.

## Immediate Next Steps

* **Start with Phase 1**: Focus on the basic file scanning and search functionality first
* **Create UI Wireframes**: Before coding, sketch out the main window, configuration dialog, and search interface
* **Set up Development Environment**: Establish the project structure, testing framework, and Claude CLI integration
* **Build Minimal Database Schema**: Start with the core file metadata structure

Would you like me to elaborate on any specific phase or help you create detailed wireframes for the MVP interface? I can also generate the initial project structure and core module templates to get you started quickly.

I'll create comprehensive UI wireframes for your file organizer utility. Let me design wireframes that cover the main interface and key dialogs, focusing on the MVP functionality while keeping future features in mind.

I've created comprehensive UI wireframes for your file organizer utility that cover the key interfaces needed for your MVP and beyond. Here's what I've designed:

## Wireframes Included:

**Skipping first 3 iterations**

**Ref: `docs/wireframes_html/file_organizer_wireframes_v4.html`** contains the HTML for the wireframe screenshots below

1 **Main Application Window** - The primary interface with:

    Menu bar and toolbar with keyboard shortcuts
    Flexible search panel with regex and filter options
    Sidebar with quick filters and file type categorization
    Results area with sortable table view
    Status bar with progress indicators

![1_main_app_window](docs/images/1_main_app_window.png)

2 **Configuration Dialog** - Directory management with:

    Visual list of included/excluded directories
    Pattern-based exclusion rules
    Scan behavior options
    Immediate rescan capability

![2_config_scan_dialog](docs/images/2_config_scan_dialog.png)

3 **Duplicate Detection Results** - Specialized view for:

    Visual comparison of duplicate groups
    Smart auto-selection algorithms
    Thumbnail previews with metadata
    Batch operation controls

![3_duplicate_detection_results](docs/images/3_duplicate_detection_results.png)

4 **Thumbnail Grid View** - Alternative results display with:

    Adjustable thumbnail sizes
    Batch selection capabilities
    Multiple sorting options

![4_thumbnail_grid_view](docs/images/4_thumbnail_grid_view.png)


## Design Principles Applied:

**User Experience Focus**:

Clear visual hierarchy with familiar desktop application patterns
Keyboard shortcuts prominently displayed
Progress feedback for long-running operations
Visual indicators for file types and selection states

**Professional Architecture**:

Modular UI components that map to your planned code structure
Consistent interaction patterns across different views
Scalable design that works with large file collections

**Security & Safety**:

Clear visual confirmation for destructive operations
Multiple selection methods to prevent accidental deletions
Undo-friendly operations with clear status feedback

Next Steps for Implementation:

1. Create GTK4 Builder XML files based on these wireframes
2. Define the main window class structure with panels as separate components
3. Implement the search and filter logic with the UI elements shown
4. Build the configuration system using the dialog design

Would you like me to help you create the actual GTK4 code structure based on these wireframes, or would you prefer to see more detailed wireframes for specific workflows (like the file preview or batch operation confirmations)?

- **MVP Features Only**: No duplicate detection or advanced analysis initially

## 🏗️ **Professional Architecture**
- **Modular Design**: Clean separation of UI, Core, and Utils layers
- **Test-Driven**: 90% coverage target with unit, integration, and performance tests
- **Security-First**: Path traversal prevention, input sanitization, safe file operations
- **Standards Compliant**: PEP 8, type hints, comprehensive documentation

## 📅 **Structured Timeline**
- **Days 1-3**: Foundation (project setup, database, configuration)
- **Days 4-6**: UI Implementation (main window, search panel, results table)
- **Days 7-10**: Integration & Testing (connect backend to UI, polish)

## 🛠️ **Claude CLI Integration**
The plan includes specific Claude CLI commands for:
- Project scaffolding and code generation
- Automated code reviews and architecture validation
- Test scaffolding and security audits

## 🔄 **Iterative Validation**
Each phase has clear deliverables and success criteria, ensuring you can validate functionality incrementally.

## 🚀 **Ready to Start?**

I recommend we begin with **Day 1: Project Setup**. Would you like me to:

1. **Generate the initial project structure** with all the directories and template files?
2. **Create the database schema** and core module templates?

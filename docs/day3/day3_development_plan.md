   - Status indicators

3. **Error Handling & Recovery**
   - Graceful error messages
   - Connection recovery
   - Corrupt file handling
   - Progress cancellation

## Implementation Priority

### High Priority (Must Have)
- Enhanced duplicate management with preview
- Basic metadata extraction
- Thumbnail generation for images
- Performance optimizations

### Medium Priority (Should Have)
- Advanced search features
- Keyboard shortcuts
- Context menus
- Better error handling

### Low Priority (Nice to Have)
- Video thumbnails
- Natural language search
- Drag & drop
- Advanced metadata

## Development Approach

### 1. Incremental Implementation
- Build one feature completely before moving to next
- Test each feature thoroughly
- Maintain backward compatibility

### 2. User Experience Focus
- Every feature should solve a real user problem
- Maintain responsive UI during operations
- Provide clear feedback and progress indication

### 3. Code Quality Standards
- Continue TDD approach
- Maintain test coverage above 80%
- Follow established architecture patterns
- Document new APIs

## Ready to Begin?

Let's start with **Phase 1: Enhanced Duplicate Management** since:
1. You already have basic duplicate detection working
2. It's a high-value feature for users
3. It builds naturally on your existing codebase
4. It provides immediate visual impact

Would you like to begin with Phase 1, or do you have a preference for which advanced feature to tackle first?

# Streamlined Test Scenarios

## Purpose 🎯

This simplified test data focuses on **immediate user understanding** with just 4 essential scenarios that anyone can relate to.

**Total files: ~25-30 (instead of 946 synthetic images)**

## Test Scenarios

### 1. 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 Family Burst Mode Photography
**The Problem**: "My kids were playing and I took 10 photos in 2 seconds. Which ones should I keep?"
**Files**: 8 photos → 2 keepers
**User Value**: Eliminates the impossible task of choosing from burst mode photos

### 2. 🌟 Celebrity Photo Collection
**The Problem**: "I have the same celebrity from different sources - which is the best quality?"
**Files**: 6 photos → 1 best + 1 AI-flagged
**User Value**: Automatically finds highest quality while identifying AI-enhanced versions

### 3. 🗼 Travel Landmark Photography
**The Problem**: "I took 5 photos of the Eiffel Tower - they're similar but slightly different"
**Files**: 5 photos → 2 keepers (different times of day)
**User Value**: Preserves variety while eliminating redundant attempts

### 4. 🤖 AI Enhancement Detection
**The Problem**: "Which of my photos have been AI-processed?"
**Files**: 4 photos → 3 flagged as AI-enhanced
**User Value**: Identifies artificially modified images for informed decisions

## Key Principles

✅ **Immediately Recognizable**: Every scenario is something users have experienced
✅ **Clear Value Proposition**: Obvious before/after improvement
✅ **Manageable Size**: Small enough to review quickly
✅ **Real-World Focused**: Addresses actual photo management problems

## Usage

1. **Quick Demo**: Show each scenario to demonstrate system capabilities
2. **User Testing**: Let users evaluate results and provide feedback
3. **Feature Validation**: Verify core functionality without overwhelming detail
4. **Onboarding**: Help new users understand what the system does
